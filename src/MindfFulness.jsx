    title: "Ayurvedic Fitness Plan: Balancing Your Health with Ancient Wisdom",
    introduction: "Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine from India, emphasizes balance in all aspects of life to achieve optimal health. Central to Ayurveda is the concept of doshasâ€”three fundamental energies that govern physiological and psychological processes in the body. Understanding your dosha can help tailor fitness and dietary plans to promote balance and well-being.",
    doshas: [
      {
        type: "Vata",
        characteristics: "Vata is characterized by qualities such as dryness, coldness, and lightness. People with a dominant Vata dosha are typically energetic, creative, and quick-thinking but may also be prone to anxiety and irregular digestion.",
        fitnessRecommendations: "Gentle yoga, stretching, and grounding exercises to promote stability and warmth. Avoid overly vigorous or erratic workouts that may increase dryness.",
        diet: "Warm, moist, and oily foods like soups, stews, and avocados. Incorporate spices such as ginger and cinnamon to stimulate digestion and maintain warmth."
      },
      {
        type: "Pitta",
        characteristics: "Pitta is associated with heat, intensity, and transformation. Individuals with a dominant Pitta dosha are often ambitious, driven, and focused but may be prone to irritability and inflammation.",
        fitnessRecommendations: "Cooling exercises such as swimming, yoga with calming postures, and relaxation techniques. Avoid high-intensity workouts that may exacerbate heat.",
        diet: "Cooling and hydrating foods like cucumbers, melons, and leafy greens. Use cooling herbs such as cilantro and mint to balance internal heat."
      },
      {
        type: "Kapha",
        characteristics: "Kapha is characterized by stability, heaviness, and solidity. People with a dominant Kapha dosha are usually calm, loyal, and resilient but may struggle with lethargy and weight gain.",
        fitnessRecommendations: "High-intensity interval training (HIIT), cardio exercises, and strength training to stimulate circulation and reduce excess heaviness. Incorporate dynamic and challenging routines to invigorate the body.",
        diet: "Light and spicy foods like salads, soups with ginger and turmeric, and meals that stimulate digestion. Avoid heavy, oily foods that can increase Kapha."

          step: "Design Your Workout Routine",
